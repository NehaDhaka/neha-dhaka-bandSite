# Bandsite
Bandsite is a web application developed for a bootcamp assignment. This is the third and final sprint of the project, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project consists of two pages: Biography and Shows.

## Pages
### Biography
The Biography page displays information about the band, including their history and accomplishments. The page also features a photo gallery of the band members. Additionally, there is a comment section at the bottom of the page where users can add, like, and delete comments. The comments are retrieved from an API, and the Axios library of JavaScript is used to make the API calls.

### Shows
The Shows page lists the upcoming shows of the band. The list is retrieved from an API and is displayed in a table format. The table includes information such as the date, time, and location of each show.

## Responsive Design
The website is fully responsive, meaning it is optimized for viewing on a range of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. The layout of the pages adjusts automatically to fit the size of the screen, providing a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started
To run the Bandsite project, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser. The website is hosted locally and does not require an internet connection to run.

## Credits
The Bandsite project was developed by Neha Dhaka as an assignment for a bootcamp. Special thanks to the bootcamp instructors for their guidance and support throughout the development process.
